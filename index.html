          Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when
          it comes to their body reacting to certain conditions - emotionally,
          mentally or physically. These “feelings” tend to get “out of control”
          during specific phases of our life, the kind that we see in movies but
          have not explicitly discussed before it happens. We start to sense a
          shift in the way our body works drastic mood swings with frequent
          tears or outbursts.
        </p>
        <p class="font-lg"><strong>The worst part?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they
          think we’re going crazy. Honestly, we are not going crazy... It's just
          menopause!
        </p>
        <p>
          Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down
          on our reproductive abilities. And it’s no fun ride. All the mood
          swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the
          never-ending list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with,
          by ourselves. But...
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the
          process of solving them (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!

        <p>
          Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause: <br />

                Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin several years before
                menopause. This could last between a few months to about 10

                  Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over
                  time. However, these are temporary symptoms of postmenopause.
                  We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors
                  which could also cause depression and anxiety.

              and estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size
              of our abdomen night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us
              feel 30 years older...are just to name a few.
