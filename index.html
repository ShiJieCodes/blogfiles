          Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when
          it comes to their body reacting to certain conditions - emotionally,
          mentally or physically. These “feelings” tend to get “out of control”
          during specific phases of our life, the kind that we see in movies but
          have not explicitly discussed before it happens.

          We start to sense a shift in the way our body works drastic mood

        <p><strong>The worst part?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they
          think we’re going crazy. Honestly, we are not going crazy... It's just
          menopause!

        <p>
          Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down
          on our reproductive abilities. And it’s no fun ride. All the mood
          swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the
          never-ending list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with,
          by ourselves. But...
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the
          process of solving them (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!

              Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin several years before
              menopause. This could last between a few months to about 10 years.
              However, on average it lasts about 4 years. What happens?

                This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts
                around the age of 40. In some cases, it could start as early as
                when women are in their 30s. This could mean a reduction in our
                fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family

                this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder.
                Hence, we notice the use of hormonal therapy or IVF for
